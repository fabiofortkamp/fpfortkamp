I know what you are going to say: I'm weird, and apparently it makes no sense to
spend time on things like this. But here it is: a post about setting different
color schemes for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), my main editor.

## Why setting different colors is good for productivity

First, let us say right away: if you spend some any significant time in a
program, making it look more pleasant, so that you'll *want* to spend more time
with it is super productive. Plus, hacking things is fun, and fun is always a 
good way to spend time.

But there is also a *contextual* component. CGP Grey illustrates how it is
good to compartimentalize your life, to train your brain to associate.

In this case, when I see a particular color scheme, I will immediately
(hopefully) start to think about the project associated with those colors. Also,
as I work with different projects alternating them within a given day (sometimes
using different programming languages), assigning a different color scheme to 
each project help me differentiate between them.

## How to set and sync color schemes in VS Code

When you configure the editor's [settings](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/settings), VS Code saves
a JSON file with your customizations in a default location
(see the aforelinked docs page). One of the settings is the color scheme:

For my default color scheme, I like the [Solarized Light](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) theme:

LINK TO JSON FILE

Now, how can this setting be changed based on the folder you open? It turns out
you can open a particular folder in VS Code, which it calls a *workspace* 
(workspaces can actually combine different folders). In the Settings UI, you
can set it to customize the *workspace* settings:

Now, when you save the settings, a `settings.json` file is created inside the
folder you are in; in the figure below, I've setup the "local" color theme to
a dark version of the solarized scheme - but this gets loaded only when I open
up that particular folder!

## My color schemes

I'll illustrate with two more projects to get you inspired. When I want to mess
around with my [dotfiles](https://github.com/fabiofortkamp/dotfiles/), I use
a grey-ish, very utilitarian-looking color scheme (Atom Dark One):

But when I work in a project involving the [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
language, which is particularly associated with blue-purple colors (check their
website), I configured VS Code with the "Tomorrow Night Blue" theme:

Please do tell me if I'm wasting my time...

In fact, my own style of working is an intersection of the two, which seem conflicting at first. The Newport approach should tell me to have “laser focus” on one skill, to be So Good They Can’t Ignore Me and become the best Python developer/Mechanical Engineer in the planet. The Kleon approach would be to Steal Like an Artist from all my influences and build my own work from them.\nI do think it’s possible to combine these two modes of working. I am not as focused as Cal Newport and cannot drop projects and ideas serially as he claims to do – my brain simply refuses to do it. I like to explore ideas, and techniques, and programming languages too much to do that. However — while I’m exploring, I can indeed focus and dive deep into what I’m learning, and not just try to be superficial.\nSo yes, I think developers and engineers should build their programming languages toolbox, and avoid the “I can only do that in Python” mentality. You can’t learn every programming language in the world, but having a few in your pocket might help you solve problems (you are an engineer, right?) in a quasi-optimal way.\nThis way, you focus on getting increasingly better as a developer in general, and not as a Python developer:\n\nMy main point is this: the more languages you learn, the more you learn about programming in general."

And in my initial explorations, I’m finding that the Julia language emphasizes vectorization, and making the code as generic as possible. Plus it is a semi-return to compiled languages (I actually learned to program in C, which sounds absurd today).\nJulia also has some interesting new packages, being the “new kid in the block”: I love the workflow emphasized by DrWatson (this alone almost is a reason to try out Julia in the first place) and the “evolution of notebooks” prescribed by Pluto.\nI know in the Instagram post above I referenced also the R language - we’ll leave that to another post."

The first coefficient is the volumetric isobaric expansivity, which measured how the volume of a substance changes you heat it up at constant pressure:\n\\[\n\\beta = \\frac{1}{v}\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T}\\right)_p\n\\]\nwhere \\(v\\) is the specific volume, \\(p\\) is the pressure and \\(T\\) the absolute temperature.

Most substances, however, expand when heated up (\\(\\beta &gt; 0\\)).\nThe volumetric expansivity may be familiar to Heat Transfer students, and it appears in Free Convection theory; fluids with large values of \\(\\beta\\) change density substantially and then move around quickly when temperature gradients are present.\nThe other coefficient is the isothermal compressibility:\n\\[\n\\alpha = -v \\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial p}\\right)_T\n\\]\nThis coefficient, with units of Pa\\(^{-1}\\) can never be negative: if you exert force in a piston with some fluid at constant temperature, it will contract."

    "text": "Calculating the speed of sound of a mixture of ideal gases\nAs an example, let’s us solve Exercise 13-92 from [1]: a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen flows through a convergent nozzle, and it exits at 500 K and a speed of 360 m/s, which is stated as the speed of sound of the mixture in that condition. What is the mass fraction of carbon dioxide in this mixture?\nFirst, some context. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen are common combustion products: gases that are formed when hydrocarbons burn with air. Other compounds are formed, such as water vapor, sulfur oxides and excess oxygen, but depending on the fuel composition and air context, carbon dioxide and nitrogen dominate the gases, and we approximate the combustion gas as a mixture of just these two gases. Convergent nozzles are commonly employed in airplane jet turbines to accelerate the fluid (the combustion gases) and generate thrust.\nLet \\(x_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}\\) be the mass fraction of carbon dioxide in the mixture, and hence \\(x_{\\mathrm{N_2}} = 1 - x_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}\\).\nWe’ll assume both components are ideal gases in the problem’s conditions, and a mixture of ideal gases is itself an ideal gas. The speed of sound for these fluids is [1]:\n\\[\nc^2 = k R T\n\\]\nwhere \\(k\\) is the ratio of isobaric to isovolumetric specific heats, and \\(R\\) is the difference between then:\n\\[\nkR = \\frac{c_p}{c_v}\\left(c_p - c_v\\right)\n\\]\nNow, the specific heats is a property that is additive:\n\\[\nc_p = x_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}c_{p,\\mathrm{CO_2}} (T) + \\left(1-x_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}\\right)c_{p,\\mathrm{N_2}} (T)\n\\]\n\\[\nc_v = x_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}c_{v,\\mathrm{CO_2}} (T) + \\left(1-x_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}\\right)c_{v,\\mathrm{N_2}} (T)\n\\] where, since the temperature is fixed, the individual values of specific heats can be read from a table.\nIf the given speed is the speed of sound, then \\(V^2 = c^2  = kRT\\), and with some rearranging the following function will achieve a zero:\n\\[\nf(x_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}) = \\frac{V^2}{c_p T} - \\frac{c_p-c_v}{c_v}\n\\]"

For instance, in steam power plants, you have compressed steam flowing in the system; if you have air that infiltrate the pipes, you’ll have a mixture of steam and air, and at the typical high pressures of boilers the specific heat of this mixture will not be the sum of individual specific heats, weighted by the mass fractions. A more appropriate mixture rule will be required. The ideal gases model for combustion gases, tough, is widely used.\n[1]: Çengel, Y. A., & Boles, M. A. Termodinâmica (7 ed.).

One month ago, however, in search of new challenges, I quit that job and got accepted at a research-only position, dealing directly with industry problems. And in only one month, I realized how much has to be changed in Mechanical Engineering curricula, to make it more modern and more aligned with practical, real problems. These are my suggestions:\n\nProper software development: Mechanical Engineering is not Computer Science. Maybe we don’t need to learn about Turing Machines, Cryptography, or Web Sockets. But my present job is the second time in my career that my primary role is implementing models in software to be used by other people, and I didn’t learn any software development in school. Students should learn more about testing, version control, different programming languages, debugging.\nMore advanced Thermodynamics: in retrospect, I think I severely underestimated my student’s ability to understand deep theories. The Refrigeration and Oil industries are primary examples where blends or mixtures of fluids are used, and in my experience students have no contact with more advanced Equations of State; there is an enormous gap between “using the ideal gas law” and “just getting the properties from a table”. But guess what: these tables are not magical, they were generated with Equations of State, and the people using them do not understand these equations.\nStudying techniques: I started teaching shortly after the pandemic; I then taught classes online, and went back to in-person classes. And what I saw is that the younger generation completely forgot how to study with full focus. I’m not talking about spending the entire weekend studying for an exam, but rather the Cal Newport style of deep work, in short but intense bursts.\n\nTo be clear: I’m not “fighting the system”. These are things that I would change if I went back to the classroom, in my own classes. Teaching Mechanical Engineering made me love the profession more than ever, and I want it to evolve - always.\nAny thoughts. Comment on Twitter or leave a note below!"

Plus, hacking things is fun, and fun is always a good way to spend time.\nBut there is also a contextual component. CGP Grey illustrates how it is good to compartimentalize your life, to train your brain to associate certain environments with a desire to focus on certain things:\n\nIn this case, when I see a particular color scheme, I will immediately start to think about the project associated with those colors. Also, as I work with different projects alternating them within a given day (sometimes using different programming languages), assigning a different color scheme to each project help me differentiate between them."

    "title": "First Law Analysis of a Mixture of Non-Ideal Gases - Exercise 13-99 from Çengel’s Thermodynamics book (7th ed)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In a previous post, we performed a First-Law Analysis, calculating work and heat transfer, of a mixture of ideal gases.\nNow we have a more realistic situation, taken from Exercise 13-99 from [1]: a mixture of 4 kg of \\(\\mathrm{He}\\) and 8 kg of \\(\\mathrm{O_2}\\) is kept in a rigid tank initially at 170 K and 7 MPa and pressure. The tank is then heated up to 220 K. What is the final pressure and the heat transfer during this process, assuming that helium is an ideal gas but oxygen is not?\nWe have two things in consideration here: first, as the oxygen is not itself is an ideal gas, its molecules will interact with each other in a way that the ideal gas model (which assumes molecules completely ignorant of the presence of other molecules, with no attraction or repulsion forces mainly) cannot predict; but second, how will the molecules of different gases interact. In other words: will the molecules of oxygen suffer forces from helium molecules as well?\nI’ll take the middle way here and use ideal gas mixture rules for non-ideal gases. The mixture is approximately a mixture of ideal gases, with little interaction between different components, but the individual behavior of the components will follow different rules.\nIndependent of the equation of state, we can start by calculating the composition of the mixture in different bases. From the given mass values, the mass fraction of helium is \\(x_{\\mathrm{He}} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) and of oxygen is \\(x_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = \\frac{2}{3}\\). The total mass is \\(m = 12\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\). Each of the \\(n\\) components has its molar mass \\(M_i\\), and the mixture molar mass can be calculated as:\n\\[\nM_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{x_i}{M_i}}\n\\]\nThe mixture gas constant is:\n\\[\nR_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{u}}}{M_{\\mathrm{m}}}\n\\]\nwhere \\(R_{\\mathrm{u}}\\) is the universal gas constant. Then the molar fraction of each component is:\n\\[\ny_i = x_i \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{m}}}{M_i}\n\\]\nWith this composition, how do we sum up individual properties? Since what we have is temperature and pressure, we can use Amagat’s rule and add the volumes - but, since we are dealing with non-ideal gases, we should use a non-dimensional volume in the form of the compressibility factor:\n\\[\nZ = \\frac{P \\mathcal{V}}{m R T}\n\\]\nThe mixture rule is then\n\\[\nZ_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i Z_i\n\\]\nwhere, since it’s an ideal gas, \\(Z_{\\mathrm{He}} = 1\\), and \\(Z_{\\mathrm{O_2}}\\) can be calculated from its equation of state. Here, we can use the mixture values of pressure and temperature, instead of partial values, as a way of already accounting for interaction forces and making the model more realistic [1].\nAt the initial state (1), then, this will give the initial mixture volume - which is preserved during the heating process. Now, if we calculate the new (at final state 2) compressibility factor of oxygen with the mixture volume instead of the pressure, there will probably a larger error, but we’’ll use that anyway\nI’ll use Python and the CoolProp library for calculating the fluid properties\nfrom CoolProp.CoolProp import PropsSI\nfrom scipy.constants import R as Ru\nimport numpy as np\n\n# convention: index 0 is helium, index 1 is oxygen\n\ncomponents = ['He','O2']\nmolar_masses = np.array([PropsSI('MOLARMASS',c) for c in components])\n\nx = np.array([1/3,2/3])\nm = 12\n\nMm = 1 / np.sum(x/molar_masses)\n\nRm = Ru/Mm\n\ny = x/molar_masses * Mm\n\nT1 = 170\nP1 = 7e6\n\nZ1 = np.array([1,PropsSI(\"Z\",\"T\",T1,\"P\",P1,components[1])])\nZm1 = np.dot(y,Z1)\n\nVm = Zm1 * m*Rm * T1/P1\n\nT2 = 220\n\n\n# notice that CoolProp work with density, not specific volumes\n# and we always use the mixture properties for the individual components\n# and only then apply mixture rule\ndensity = m/Vm\n\nZ2 = np.array([1,PropsSI(\"Z\",\"T\",T2,\"D\",density,components[1])])\nZm = np.dot(y,Z2)\n\nP2 = Zm * m*Rm * T2/Vm\n\nprint(\"New pressure = %.2f MPa\" %(P2*1e-6,))\n\nNew pressure = 9.90 MPa\nNow, to calculate heat transfer, we need to apply the First Law of Thermodynamics. Since we have a closed system with no volume variation and overall no indication of shaft work, the First Law reads:\n\\[\nQ = U_2 - U_1\n\\]\nwhere \\(U\\) is the total internal energy. Assuming there is no chemical reactions, the internal energy can be broken down into two separate systems, for each component. For helium (an ideal gas), we assume constant specific heats and use the fact that the internal energy of ideal gases depend only on temperatures. For the non-ideal oxygen gas, we use the residual enthalpy \\(\\Delta h^*\\), which is how much the enthalpy of the gas deviated from an ideal gas model. Keep in mind that:\n\\[\nu = h - Pv = h - ZRT\n\\]\nHence, to calculate the internal energy variation for oxygen, we need to account for three terms:\nCalculating everything:\nTmean = (T1 + T2)/2\n\n# notice that CoolProp does not have an ideal gas constant-volume specific heat\n# and that we have to provide a second argument, even if it only requires temperature\nR_He = Ru / molar_masses[0]\ncvHe = PropsSI(\"Cp0mass\",\"T\",Tmean,\"P\",P2,components[0]) - R_He\n\ndu_He = cvHe*(T2 - T1)\n\n# now, to use the residual properties, we have to use molar properties\n\ncpmolarO2 = PropsSI(\"Cp0molar\",\"T\",Tmean,\"P\",P2,components[1])\ndh_ig_O2 = cpmolarO2*(T2-T1)\n\ndresidual_1 = PropsSI(\"HMOLAR_RESIDUAL\",\"T\",T1,\"P\",P1,components[1])\ndresidual_2 = PropsSI(\"HMOLAR_RESIDUAL\",\"T\",T2,\"P\",P2,components[1])\ndhu = Ru*(Z2[1]*T2 - Z1[1]*T1)\n\ndu_O2 = 1/(molar_masses[1]) * (dh_ig_O2 + dresidual_2 - dresidual_1 - dhu)\n\nQ = m*(x[0]*du_He + x[1]*du_O2)\nprint(\"Heat transfer = %.2f kJ\" %(Q*1e-3))\n\nHeat transfer = 972.99 kJ"

Both Writing Powerful Command-Line Applications in Go and Writing Interpreters in Go focus on that: writing useful programs, without nitty-picking syntax details.\nWhy my obsession with Go in particular?

Yes, there’s a refactoring plugin by the legend himself, but when in this headspace I just want to use the mouse, you know?

Yes, with tmux sessions you can delimit the context in which you are working, with each pane or window pointing to a specific folder, and when you are done you simply detach from a session, but for me opening a PyCharm IDE has a very strong meaning: for the next hour and a half, I’m working on this big Python project that need automated editing.\nSo yes, I use Neovim all the time; I have my config, I use beautiful themes, I follow the right NeoVim creators.

The system is heated up and expands, but due to the action of a spring, the pressure variation as a function of volume \\(P(\\mathcal{V})\\) follows:\n\\[\nP = A + K \\mathcal{V}\n\\] where \\(A = 111.111\\,\\mathrm{kPa}\\) and \\(K = 888.89\\,\\mathrm{kPa/m^3}\\). During the heating, volume doubles; what is the work and heat transfers associated with the process?\nFor that, in contrast with the previous posts, now we’ll use Python and the pyromat package, which I’ve just discovered today.\nWith the added heat, the system will expand and perform work, which can be calculated using only mechanics:\n\\[\nW = \\int_{\\mathcal{V}_1}^{\\mathcal{V}_2} P \\mathrm{d}\\mathcal{V}\n\\]\nWhere the initial volume can be obtained from the given pressure variation, and the final volume is double that:\nA = 111.111\nK = 888.89\n\nP1 = 200\nV1 = (P1-A)/K\nprint(\"V1 = %.2f m3\" %(V1))\nV2 = 2*V1\n\nV1 = 0.10 m3\nThe integration above gives:\n\\[\nW = A * (\\mathcal{V}_2 - \\mathcal{V}_1) + \\frac{K}{2}\\left(\\mathcal{V}_2^2 - \\mathcal{V}_1^2\\right)\n\\]\nand calculating it:\nW = A*(V2-V1) + K/2*(V2**2 - V1**2)\nprint(\"W = %.2f kJ\" %(W,))\n\nW = 24.44 kJ\nTo compute the heat added to the system, a First Law analysis reads:\n\\[\nQ = W + \\Delta U = W + m c_v (T_2-T_1)\n\\]\nwhere, assuming a mixture of ideal gases (an hypothesis not used so far!), all mass-specific properties are additive. The gas constant is:\n\\[\nR = \\sum_{i=1}^k x_i R_i\n\\] where \\(k = 2\\) components, \\(x_i\\) is the individual mass fraction and \\(R_i\\) the individual gas constant. The gas constant is needed to compute the temperature variation; at state 1, the mass (which is constant in all states for a closed system) is computed from the ideal gas equation of state:\n\\[\nm = \\frac{P_1 V_1}{R T_1}\n\\]\nand now, applying the same equation for state 2:\n\\[\nT_2 = \\frac{P_2 V_2}{m R}\n\\]\nwhere \\(P_2\\) can be obtained from the pressure-volume equation.\nThe constant-volume specific heat for ideal gases is a function of temperature only, and for better accuracy can be calculated at the average temperature. The mixture specific heat is computed similarly to the gas constant above.\nThe pyromat library has function to create ideal gas “objects” and then access constants and functions as illustrated below:\nimport pyromat as pm\nN2 = pm.get(\"ig.N2\") # ig = ideal gas model\nCO2 = pm.get(\"ig.CO2\")\n\nxN2 = 0.55\nxCO2 = 1-xN2\n\n# each object has a .R() method to calculate the gas constant\n# the default units are kJ, kPa, m3, K, kmol\nR = xN2*N2.R() + xCO2*CO2.R()\n\nT1 = 45 + 273\nm = (P1*V1)/(R*T1)\n\nP2 = A + K*V2\nT2 = (P2*V2)/(m*R)\n\nTmean = (T1 + T2)/2\n\ncv = xN2*N2.cv(T=Tmean) + xCO2*CO2.cv(T=Tmean)\n\nQ = W + m*cv*(T2-T1)\nprint(\"Q = %.2f kJ\" %(Q,))"

After a recomendation from Dr. Drang, I often use Tabula: this app allows you to upload PDFs and extract a text table from it:\nThe result can be downloaded as a CSV and cleaned up; it is also useful to explicitly include the condensing temperature as a column, in the case we want to generalize the results of this post to other temperatures:\nThis can be parsed with pandas:\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"compressor.csv\",delimiter=',')\nprint(df)\n\n   Evaporating Temperature [C]  Condensing temperature [C]  \\\n0                          -35                          35   \n1                          -30                          35   \n2                          -25                          35   \n3                          -20                          35   \n4                          -15                          35   \n5                          -10                          35   \n\n   Cooling Capacity [W]  Power [W]  Current [A]  Gas Flow Rate [kg/h]  \\\n0                   167        129         1.21                  1.79   \n1                   218        144         1.23                  2.34   \n2                   282        160         1.27                  3.03   \n3                   362        177         1.32                  3.89   \n4                   457        197         1.38                  4.93   \n5                   570        217         1.45                  6.16   \n\n    Efficiency [W/W]  \n0               1.29  \n1               1.52  \n2               1.77  \n3               2.04  \n4               2.33  \n5               2.63"

Three points of note:\n\nThis polynomial allows you to interpolate in different points other than the tabulated ones, an also can be combined with other models in the refrigeration system;\nThe coefficients themselves are function of the condensing temperature, the fluid properties and the compressor geometry;\nThe same thing can be done for the power consumption, with different coefficients.\n\nWe will use scikit-learn to train a model to calculate the coefficients, based on 50% of the data selected at random:\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\nX = df.values[:,:1] # first column (evaporating temperature) as a 2D array, as required\nYQL = df[\"Cooling Capacity [W]\"].values\n\nX_train,X_test,QL_train,QL_test = train_test_split(X,YQL,test_size=0.5)\n\nQL_quadratic_model = Pipeline(\n[\n('poly', PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)),\n('linear', LinearRegression(fit_intercept=False))])\nQL_quadratic_model.fit(X_train, QL_train)\nQL_quadratic_pred = QL_quadratic_model.predict(X_test)\n\nfig4, ax4 = plt.subplots()\nax4.scatter(QL_test,QL_quadratic_pred)\nax4.grid()\nax4.set_xlabel('Simulated cooling capacity [W]]')\nax4.set_ylabel('Predicted cooling capacity [W]')\nax4.set_title('accuracy (R^2) =  %.5f'\n% r2_score(QL_test, QL_quadratic_pred))\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting coefficients are (from \\(a_0\\) to \\(a_2\\)):\n\nprint(QL_quadratic_model.named_steps[\"linear\"].coef_)\n\n[8.32e+02 2.95e+01 3.00e-01]\n\n\nHence, this polynomial seems to work fine, even though we have very few data points; with more data points in a test apparatus, this same model could be retrained, making the coefficients more and more accurate.\nThe advantage of this approach is that, if we are working with this compressor and selecting heat exchangers sizes, for instance, we do not need to evaluate thermophysical properties at each iteration but only a polynomial, which is a huge time saver. How to make this integration between models is the subject of another post.\nUPDATE: there’s a follow-up post which corrects some mistakes that you should read now."

I began developing User-Defined Functions in Fluent in the C programming language (good times).\nBefore graduating, I took an internship position at KIT. I worked in a project that involved the refrigeration industry, but… as a developer, I guess? I spent all days in the VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) editor, implementing models for compressors, valves, heat exchangers, fluid properties – and all inside Excel, so that engineers and managers could do their thing without having to open Matlab, or Python, and any code editor.\nQuick: was I a Mechanical Engineer, or a Software Developer?"

This is the most complex code I’ve ever worked with, and I have to deal with collaborating with other people with Git, keeping track of Python versions (and Python packages versions), debugging, testing. I’m also writing reports in Quarto, and beginning to study some Julia (more on this in a later post). These are all related to Mechanical Engineering, and involve serious programming tasks, and this requires serious programming tools.\nI’m not saying that you can’t do serious development in Windows – I’ve done that my whole career. But I was trained to be a programmer in Linux, while taking all those Computer Engineering classes in Portugal. My assignments were to work with a terminal app (like the one you see above), type commands in it and then write code in a text editor. After learning Linux at U. Porto, I couldn’t go back to the Command Prompt in Windows. In later years, I tried out Cygwin and Git Bash, but these were more hacks than anything else and problems always appeared. For instance, you can indeed have a great terminal experience (I even wrote my own configuration scripts for using terminals in Windows), but basic tools like make aren’t included. I love working with VS Code, and it doesn’t integrate well with either Cygwin or Git Bash.\nSo I decided to try out the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which allows me to use Windows apps but with the Linux command line and tools. I should have just learned Powershell, but here we are.\nBy the way: if you getting more serious into programming tasks in Windows, you should check out Scott Hanselman’s blog. He writes a lot about Windows apps and tools — while also recommending WSL."

Basically, it’s a different interface with your Windows PC.\nAfter installing it, what you get is a virtual machine that is running a version of Linux. I went with the default options: I’m running Ubuntu – maybe you can see that I even used the official wallpaper from the current (22.04) Long-Term-Support (LTS) distribution, Jammy Jellyfish. By the way: I’m running the Windows Terminal Preview, a very modern terminal app. If you install WSL and this app, a profile will be created, and you can select it when opening a new tab:\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Windows Terminal menu of opening new profiles\n\n\nI’ve set up Windows Terminal so that the Ubuntu profile is the default one, and also set it to open automatically at startup:\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Windows Terminal settings\n\n\nAnd with this script (for AutoHotkey), which is also in my Startup folder, I set up the keystroke Ctrl-Shit-Alt-I to toggle opening and hiding the terminal.\n\n\nGetting around the command line\nWith WSL, you don’t get a full Linux distribution, which its own graphical user interface – you only have the command line, so it’s essential to use it well.\nWhen I was learning Linux, The Linux Command Line by William Shots was an essential reference - and it’s free! I highly recommend it as a first step.\nI’ve taken one step further from the book above, which uses the bash shell, and set zsh as my default system. Here’s my current configuration, which uses oh-my-zsh. Being able to do these sorts of customizations is the main point of using Linux on Windows.\n\n\nAccessing Windows programs\nThe beauty of WSL is that it can be thought of as just an interface. For instance, as I said above, I use VS Code, and I downloaded it and installed it as a regular Windows program, and it is in my PATH environment variable set in Windows. But in WSL, if I type code, it opens the Windows VS Code app – it knows there to look at! In the WSL shell, (you navigate the Linux virtual machine directories, as well as the native Windows folder)."

You can change the global hatch configuration to always use that location when using the hatch command with this shell commands:\nhatch env prune # delete previously created environments\nhatch config set dirs.env.virtual \".hatch\" # modify configuration\nNow, when you run a hatch command, it will create environments under .hatch.\nNow you have to configure pyright in your pyproject.toml file.

As a bonus, you can import pytest in the test files to add fixtures and other goodies.\nI hope this is helpful! Let me know if you want to learn more about Hatch or Neovim."

I remember it “being OK”, without much resonance; however, now that I’m primarily a software developer, I thought it was time for a review.\nThe Pragmatic Programmer starts with a list of tips that are obvious to me: be professional, care about your work, focus on quality, make learning a habit. The first tip that actually sounded as something new and noteworthy (at least for me, someone who doesn’t have a degree in Computer Science or anything related) was the importance of developing your own domain specific languages (DSL): think about common and repetitive tasks you have to do, encode how you would describe them in a dedicated language, and then create a program that will evaluate this language.\nAs it turns out, I do have lots of tasks that could use a specific language. In my daily work, I deal with JSON files that follow a specific configuration (describing inputs and outputs to simulations) that very often trigger the same sort of analysis. A DSL for my line of work would look like this:\nfor results in list_of_results:\n    plot temperature vs position\n    plot pressure vs position\n    calculate maximum pressure\n\nplot maximum pressure of each result vs initial pressure of each result\nThis actually would be useful!

The book is well written, didactic without assuming the reader is stupid. It doesn’t require the reader know a lot of Go, and it doesn’t waste time explaning the syntax either - I can always just look it up.\nThis is a book for software developers, and the author assumes software developer can learn details of programming languages. Most importantly, it’s a book about software development: thinking about data structures, developing incremental tests for their behaviour, not being afraid of creating functions that have just one line of code if they make understanding the program much easier, organizing the code into separate modules. All of these are useful things that I always to improve in my job."

    "text": "What I’m applying in my daily work as a Python developer\nMy main project at work is a simulator that was originally written by another very talented engineer, and that I now have to maintain and extend. Very often we and our clients deal with problems when reading and parsing the input files: some fields are missing or they are too complex. Inspired by these studies, I’m becoming less and less afraid of creating small data structures and functions that process one small part at a time - instead of just trying to conform to what is already in the code.\nYes, I develop Python application, but the language is just a detail. The book could be re-written in Python and the ideas, the theory, the methods would be the same. If I re-implemented my main project in Go (which I actually dream of, to get all the static cross-compilation benefits), my clients couldn’t care less - they want simulation results. I’m a firmly believer of being programming languages polyglot and being able to study books that show code in different languages.\nI’ll have more to say when I advance in the book and use more and more of its ideas in my Python projects. In the meanwhile, give Writing an Interpreter in Go… a go."

    "title": "Calculting equilibrium composition of a mixture of gases - Exercise 16-89 from Çengel’s Thermodynamics book (7th ed)",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is exercise 16-89 from [1]: a mixture of 1 mol of \\(\\mathrm{H_2O}\\), 2 mols of \\(\\mathrm{O_2}\\) and 5 mols of \\(\\mathrm{N_2}\\) is heated up to 2200 K and 5 atm of pressure. The final composition will have the formation of \\(\\mathrm{H_2}\\) as well; what is the equilibrium composition, and is it reasonable to assume there will be no \\(\\mathrm{OH}\\) in the final composition?\nI teach several classes on heat engines, steam generators and internal combustion engines, and for me the prime application of chemical thermodynamics and equilibrium composition is emissions. For a given combustion reaction, will pollutants such as \\(\\mathrm{NO}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{CO}\\) be formed? How much of them? The exercise explained above is a nice example of such calculations.\nAll calculations below assume all components are ideal gases.\nFirst, we need to write the reaction:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{H_2O} + 2\\mathrm{O_2} + 5\\mathrm{N_2} \\to x\\mathrm{H_2O} + y\\mathrm{O_2} + z\\mathrm{N_2} + w\\mathrm{H_2}\n\\]\nwhere the unknowns \\({x,y,v,w}\\) form a vector to be found with an appropriate system of equations. Since we have three elements (\\(\\mathrm{N,O,H}\\)), or equivalently \\((\\mathrm{N_2,O_2,H_2})\\)), we can write three mass balances:\nFor hydrogen gas:\n\\[\nx + w -1 = 0\n\\]\nFor oxygen gas:\n\\[\n2.5-0.5x-y=0\n\\]\nFor nitrogen gas:\n\\[\n5-z = 0\n\\]\n(Do you have any doubts on why these equations are as such?)\nOne missing equation has to be determined from equilibrium considerations. Looking at tables of equilibrium constants, I posit that the free hydrogen gas is formed by dissociation:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H_2} + \\frac{1}{2}\n\\mathrm{O_2}\n\\] whose equilibrium constant at 2200 K is \\(\\ln K_p = -6.768\\).\nThe definition of equilibrium coefficient for this latter equation is [1]:\n\\[\nK_p = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{H_2}}^{\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}}} N_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}}}}{N_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}^{\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}}\\left(\\frac{P}{N_{\\mathrm{total}}} \\right)^{\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} - \\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}\n\\] where the \\(\\nu_i\\) are the stoichiometric coefficients in the dissociation equation, the \\(N_i\\) are the real molar contents in the actual system where the dissociation occur, and \\(P\\) is the pressure in atm:\n\\[\nK_p = \\frac{w^{1} y^{0.5}}{x^{1}}\\left(\\frac{5}{x + y + z + w} \\right)^{0.5}\n\\]\nTake a minute and see if you can understand this equation. It took me almost an hour to properly understand it.\nThe vector of unknowns then is the solution of a 4-dimensional function, and this problem can be solved numerically with R:\nlibrary(rootSolve)\nmodel &lt;- function(a) c(F1 = 1-a[1] - a[4], \n                       F2 = 2.5-0.5*a[1]-a[2],\n                       F3 = 5-a[3],\n                       F4 = ((a[4]*a[2]**0.5)/(a[1])*(5/(sum(a)))^0.5) -exp(-6.768))\n\nss &lt;- multiroot(f = model, start = c(1,1,1,1), positive=TRUE)\nprint(ss)\n\n$root\n[1] 0.998972571 2.000513714 5.000000000 0.001027429\n\n$f.root\n           F1            F2            F3            F4 \n 1.685501e-15 -1.332268e-15  0.000000e+00  1.414749e-13 \n\n$iter\n[1] 4\n\n$estim.precis\n[1] 3.612318e-14\nKeep in mind that I had to tweak this code until it worked. For instance, if you write the fourth equation in terms of logarithms, and not with exponentials as I did, you might have some numerical problems (try!). Also, the solution is sensitive to initial conditions; the final solution makes sense, as oxygen and nitrogen are practically preserved and some of the water vapor in fact dissociates.\nAs for the underlying assumption: will there be \\(\\mathrm{OH}\\) in the final composition? The equilibrium constant for \\(\\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{OH} + \\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{H_2}\\) at 2200 K is \\(\\ln K_p = -7.148\\). The dissociation constants from water vapor to \\(\\mathrm{H_2}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{OH}\\) are very similar, and hence the reactions will occur in parallel, giving some amount of \\(\\mathrm{OH}\\) in the products, contrary to our assumptions. If you actually perform an experiment similar to this problem and encounter some errors in the final composition, this is a likely source of deviations.\nThe smaller the value of \\(K_p\\), the harder is for the reaction to occur; you can see from the above equations that this coefficient is a measure of how much products form from the reactants. Hence, for similar \\(K_p\\), the amount of \\(\\mathrm{H_2}\\) and \\(\\mathrm{OH}\\) formed will also be similar."

    "text": "Studying in stages\nThe basic premise of the book, and something that I apply to almost everything I read, is that reading or studying should be done in stages. I felt quite at home when Adler and van Doren talk about the classic error of trying to read a difficult book, stumping into the first hard concept, and then being stuck for hours in the same chapter - without even understanding what the book is about. Depending on the book level, you will not understand it in the first reading.\nHence, when you have anything to read in front of you, the first step is to do an Inspectional Reading - a high-level form of reading, aiming for general concepts and the overall structure of the book or document, without wasting time on details."

Of course! But I did not let it stop me of skimming through the whole book. I was actually looking for some details about differential equations, and I have to say I do not understand them yet – but I do know that this book has some answers, and I know where to look. I need another deep work session to do an analytical reading - subject of another post."
